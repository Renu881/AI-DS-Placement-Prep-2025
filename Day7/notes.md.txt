## Word Count:
- Count words by splitting the string by spaces.

## Prime Number:
- Checks if a number is divisible by any number between 2 and itself.
- Optimized by checking up to the square root of `n`.

## Extra Tasks:
- Reverse string using slicing.
- Count vowels by iterating through the string.
